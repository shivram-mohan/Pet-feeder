An IoT Based Pet feeder system using Arduino Uno MCU, Bluetooth module, Servo motor
The Arduino is coded in embedded C language, in arduino IDE
The app is made using MIT App Controller 
The hardware is connected as per the circuit diagram, and wooden stands, containers are used for the assembling of this system
Can be improved by using different stand positions, adding a timer in the code for timely feeding purposes.
